# 2021 Internship Menu Exercise

Tackle the following steps to create a menu for a "Fancy Italian Restaurant".

## 1. Sorting

- In `index.js`, loop over `menuItems` and categorize them into sections based on each items assigned `type`
- Sort the items in each category by their `menuOrder`

## 2. Rendering

- Render the sorted results into the appropriate container with `index.html`
- Format any prices. For example, 8.5 becomes \$8.50
- Render the "spicy" icon next to any menu items where `spicy` is `true`

## 3. Styling

- Add some "italian menu" styling to boost your stores sales. Use Google Images if you need inspiration.

## 4. BONUS: Filtering

- Add a checkbox to toggle spicy options. When the checkbox is checked, the spicy options should be visible. It should be checked by default.

# Work / Project Examples

I recently built a tic tac toe game in React. The application indicates if there is a winner or a tie game. It also keeps track of the every move as the game progresses and, allows a player to review the game’s history by listing the previous moves. A player can reverse to one of the previous game state. I also developed the same game in Python but with the goal to learn more about machine learning. In my python version, a player can match against a computer and the computer’ moves are generated so that it never looses a game.
I also designed and built a chess game in java. I utilized the MVC pattern in my application. I implemented the chess board and pieces. The pieces move on the board by dragging them with a mouse. I also implemented a function to show all the possible moves of a piece when it’s selected. I also integrated a checkmate functionality.

# Inspiration

I am a gamer and I appreciate games that release frequent updates to fix bugs and upgrade the gameplay experience, especially when it is a game that is free to play. Apex legends is one of those games and I got excited about the programming aspects of the game after reading this blog post from the lead developer here https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/servers-netcode-developer-deep-dive
I recently came accross this app on codePen and I was really impressed by the animation and the possibilities that it offers for creativity. I have taken a computer graphics class and understand the basic concepts of rendering an image and I would love to one day be able to create similar apps https://codepen.io/PavelDoGreat/pen/zdWzEL

# Focus

I will use my time at CM to grow into a well rounded developer. I want to learn the process of designing and implementing a real life application. I want to learn the best techniques from my peers and I hope to use this knowledge to contribute to an ongoing project. I would like to improve my knowledge of webpage styling and cross platform functionality.
